# if you are taking the exam

 1. Please read __every__ single line of comment, this exercise has been run hundreds of time. there might still be an error but it's very very unlikely.
 2. Difficulty is increasing, solve test one by one, __we want to see your method__ not the overall solution magically jump out of the hat.
 3. Do commit & push each time a new test becomes green.
 4. Keep in mind that this is a session to asses your coding skills : __how you are doing stuff__ is as important as passing all the tests.

You're not allowed to change a single character of the tests

Good luck :D



# if you are benching the exercise

up to you, but feel free to create your own branch to host your solution and discuss it with team mates
please commit somewhere or tell me how long it took you to perform

Guillaume.
